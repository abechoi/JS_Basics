	VARIABLES

	Working with variables
	1. Declare two variables: admin and name.
	2. Assign the value "John" to name.
	3. Copy that value from name to admin.
	4. Show the value of admin using alert (must output "John").

	Giving the right name
	1. Create a variable with the name of our planet. How would you name such a variable?
	2. Create a variable to store the name of a current visitor to a website. How would you name that variable?
